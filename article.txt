Procurement Management System — Functions & Purpose

Overview
The Procurement Management System (PMS) centralizes and automates procurement-related workflows for an organization. It tracks procurement documents from request (PR) to purchase order, captures review and approval timestamps, records PHILGEPS posting details (when applicable), supports comments and audit trails, and provides reports and status overviews for managers and administrators.

Primary Purpose
- Standardize procurement processes and recordkeeping.
- Provide a single source of truth for procurement documents and their lifecycle.
- Improve transparency and traceability by capturing who did what and when.
- Offer summary views and reports to support decision-making and compliance.

Key Functions and Modules
- Document Management
	- Create, edit and view procurement records (PR No., particulars, supplier, amount, contract cost, dates).
	- Store relevant timestamps (received by BO/BAC/GSO, PO date, AIR date, return for completion) and render them in the UI.

- Role-based Access
	- Admin: full access to all records, users, and reports.
	- Manager: create and manage procurement documents, review progress and comments for assigned projects.
	- Regular user/Staff: view documents assigned to them and submit or update progress/comments as permitted.

- PHILGEPS Posting Controls
	- Support for tracking whether a procurement was posted to PHILGEPS and related fields (RFQ No., reposting, returned for abstract).
	- If a document is marked "Without Posting", PHILGEPS-only fields are excluded from completion calculations.

- Timestamp Automation & Immutability
	- "Set now" checkboxes allow users to quickly stamp current datetime into fields.
	- Inputs set via "Set now" are readonly to avoid accidental edits; certain key timestamps (e.g., first received timestamp) can be treated as immutable by server logic.

- Progress Tracking
	- Document progress is computed as the ratio of completed form fields to total required fields (configurable list), with PHILGEPS and remarks fields optionally excluded depending on procurement type or posting choice.
	- Progress is shown as a percentage and progress bar in document lists.

- Comments and Activity Feed
	- Users can add comments tied to a document; comments are stored with user and timestamp and support view/delete operations (permissioned).

- Reports & Exports
	- Generate printable or exportable reports summarizing procurement activity, timelines, and costs.

- Simple Audit / History
	- Record creation and update timestamps for records; server-side enforcement prevents unauthorized changes to protected fields.

Implementation Notes
- Technology stack: PHP (procedural with small action class), MySQL/MariaDB (mysqli), jQuery/AJAX, Bootstrap for UI.
- Formatted datetimes in the UI use a consistent input format; server normalizes inputs to MySQL datetime format before saving.
- The application uses server-side validation in `save_project()` and other endpoints to ensure required fields are present and to normalize values.

Getting Started (developer / local run)
1. Place the project folder inside your webserver document root (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs\procurement_management_system`).
2. Create a MySQL database and import the provided SQL schema file (e.g., `pms_db.sql`).
3. Update `db_connect.php` with your database credentials.
4. Open the app in a browser (e.g., `http://localhost/procurement_management_system/index.php`).

Tips for Use and Customization
- To change which fields affect progress, update the fields list in `document_list.php` or implement a configurable settings table.
- To make immutable rules stricter, enforce them in `admin_class.php::save_project()` before building SQL updates.
- For security and correctness, consider converting raw SQL string concatenation to prepared statements.
